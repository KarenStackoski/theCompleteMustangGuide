            Karen Stackoski, the creator of this website, is a big fan of the Mustang's story, and 
            also, a big fan of auto racing and cars in general. Her favorite car is a 2021 Mustang
            Mach1, which has a 5.0 V8 engine, has 483hp and a top speed of 166mph, or 267kph. It's 
            such a powerful car, and a beautiful car. In the case of Karen, the blue one is the 
            most wonderful car in the world. Karen started to search more about the Mustang story 
            when she was 11 years old, and immediately became a big fan. She now has a book with 
            the most important models and the whole story behind Ford's little horse. She also has 
            Mustang wallpapers about all her cellphone, and there's a lot of them in all of her 
            chats on WhatsApp.
