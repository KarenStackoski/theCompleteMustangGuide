        <h3 class="first">Mustang nowadays</h3>
        <p> In these days, Ford is releasing different models of Mustang, like the Mustang Mach-e, which is an eletric Mustang
            in a SUV bodywork. This model made some Mustang fans get angry, because the name Mustang reminds a V8 engine with
            so much power and not a car with a eletric engine, which doesn't make the traditional noise that a Mustang makes. 
            Now, Ford is introducing the new Mustang generation, which will be released in 2024. This new generation has a 
            most agressive desing than the current generation, and already have a special version, called Dark Horse. No 
            informations were released until the moment that this text was written, but the mustang fans are excited to see
            how iconic will be this generation. In the images below you can see the GT Mustang 2024, in the releasement
            color, a gray-blue that show this agressive design.
